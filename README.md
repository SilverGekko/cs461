## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of creating and using a Virtual Reality (VR) training program for HP Inc.'s industrial printer: the HP Page-Wide WebPress. When a customer purchases a Page-Wide WebPress, they must be flown out to an HP location that houses a WebPress to attend an intensive, week-long training seminar. This training program is not only time-consuming, but very expensive. This project aims to create a prototype VR training program to showcase the feasibility of replacing at least one of the in-person seminar days with a virtual reality program that can be shipped (a long with a VR headset) to the customer's location.

## Installation

See "User Guide" in the LaTeX folder for information about how to test/run this project.

## Project Metrics
1) A VR environment is constructed with a PageWide Web Press in the scene. This environment should include recognizable graphics, sounds, and appear to represent a real world work environment to a reasonable extent.

2) The user can move around within the scene using the provided VR headset, and the user can interact with the Web Press in at least one way using the provided controllers.

3) The interactive parts of the VR press simulate at least one major function in virtual reality that would be covered in the physical reality training. Instructions should be given to the user with in-game audio and visual cues.

4) The virtual reality press simulates failure when the VR press is operated incorrectly (controls used in the wrongorder) in at least one (ideally all) of the functions in the training.

5) Outside individuals with no prior knowledge can complete the training successfully, without triggering a failure (when allowed repeat attempts), using only the instructions and prompts within the VR simulation.

6) Positive user feedback on interaction and intuitive gameplay mechanisms, especially for users with no background in virtual reality or gaming controls in general.

7) Framework that can be used to easily implement future training scenarios after completion of capstone.

8) After completing the VR training program, users can correctly identify parts and functions of the real press that were covered in the program.
